# Day 7

I made Wordle instead of Hangman.  Close enough, right?

If you've made it this far in your own study, that's great!  It's okay if it
took more than 7 days, the important thing is that you keep at it.  Practice is
the best way, really the only practical way, to learn this skill.  It can be
confusing at times, and there is a lot of new terminology and different ways of
thinking about problem solving.  There will always be more to learn, either in
computing or in new libraries & environments or in new topics to integrate into
a technology-based solution.  Personally, that's part of the enjoyment for me,
because there's always something new to learn.  There is also the satisfaction
of making a thing with just concentration and enough time, but I also really
enjoy learning new things.  If you do too then this is a great field to be in.
Keep up the effort and dedication!
